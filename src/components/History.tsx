      <p>
        I’m a passionate software engineer who loves creating applications and
        constantly learning. My journey began as a network engineer, where I
        worked on a Python project that sparked my curiosity in programming.
        Eager to learn more, I taught myself JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which
        led me to Hack Reactor — a 9-month immersive bootcamp in full-stack
        development. There, I collaborated with fellow engineers on a range of
        projects. Since graduating, I’ve continued to grow through freelance
        work and internships. I'm driven by curiosity, a love for
        problem-solving, and a desire to keep improving. I’m always excited for
        new opportunities!
